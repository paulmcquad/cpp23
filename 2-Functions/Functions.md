# Functions

A function is a set of statements that is given a name, and which can be called from at some point in the program.

# Why Do we need functions?

1. Functions help us in reducing code redundancy.
2. Functions make code modular.
3. Functions provide abstraction.

# How to use functions?

These are the steps to use functions:

1. We write a function declaration (sometimes called a function prototype) that tells the compiler about the number of parameters, data types of parameters, and returns type of function.
2. We write a function definition (Press F12 on VSCode) to preform the operation.
3. We use the function by calling it in your code.
